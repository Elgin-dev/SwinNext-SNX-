# SwinNext-SNX-
SwinNext (SNX) is a hybrid ConvNeXt + Swin‑Tiny model for histopathology image classification, capturing fine local textures and global tissue context. Its dual‑branch fusion is designed to be magnification‑aware and stain‑invariant, enabling robust multi‑class tumor prediction on datasets like LC25000 and BreakHis.
